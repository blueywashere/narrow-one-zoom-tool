# How to Use the Tool

Head over to [Narrow One](https://narrow.one/), once you're in-game, hold right-click to zoom in!

# Edit the Zoom

If you want to edit the zoom value (by deafult it's set to 2), you can do so by navigating the to unzipped folder you downloaded, opening it, select **zoom.js**, right-click it and open it with a code editor (I recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)). Go to line 6 and change the **zoom** value to whatever you'd like. Do NOT set it under 1 as it will zoom out.
